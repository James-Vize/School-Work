# Lab: Password Checker

## Description

In this lab you must create a program that checks if user-entered password is valid. For this scenario we will check the password against a hardcoded value. The program must meet the following criteria:

1. Program is in a file named "password_checker.py".
2. The correct password should be hardcoded to the string "correct".
3. If the password is correct, output "Success!" and exit.
4. If the password is incorrect, output "Incorrect password." and prompt the user again.
5. BONUS (+10): If the user enters the password incorrectly three times, output "Account locked." and exit.

## Output

_Example Runs:_

```
Enter your password: wrong1
Incorrect password.
Enter your password: correct
Success!
```

Bonus only:

```
Enter your password: wrong1
Incorrect password.
Enter your password: wrong2
Incorrect password.
Enter your password: wrong3
Account locked.
```

## Programming and Grading Tips
- Use appropriate comments and code style. 
- Check your program every time you make a change; don't wait until the end to test.
- Make use of the debugger to step through your code.
- Match the formatting from the example run exactly, including spacing and punctuation.
- Test all combinations of inputs that lead you through the various paths of the program.
- Make sure that your program doesn't crash - programs that don't run can't be graded!
