Requirements:

- String Input from the user
- This will calculate the frequency of each letter in the input string.
- The shift of the cipher is calculated by the ordinal positioning of the letter and the frequency of it.
- It will then shift each letter by the calculated amount.
- If the shift exceeds the amount of letters it will then wrap around. 
- Display the encoded message.
- Display the Hashing of the alphabet. 

Functions:
- calculateShift(letter: string, frequency: input) -> integer:
    Purpose:
    - calculates the shift value for a letter, multiply the frequency by the ordinal value.
- encodedMessage(message: string) -> string:
    Purpose
    - Encodes the input message using the shift, return the encoded message and display it.
- displayHashing(frequency: string):
    Purpose:
    - Display the alphabet with frequency counts. Display the letter followed by its frequency.

Challenges and Considerations:
- Dealing with the larger shift values that are longer than the alphabet.
- Considering the User experience.
- Ensuring the program can use both uppercase and lowercase lettering.
